      <summary>
            These types are used to implement properties such as ITypeDefinition.IsEnum, which relies on checking
            that the base type is a well known type form the core assembly (mscorlib, for example). This module
            may refer to these types via a reference assembly which forwards type references to the real core assembly.
            Since we should not resolve any type references, and since the host's platform types may be referencing
            the real core assembly, we need to set up references to types from this module's idea of the core assembly.
